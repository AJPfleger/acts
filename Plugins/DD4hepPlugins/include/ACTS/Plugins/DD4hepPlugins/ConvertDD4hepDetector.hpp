/// @brief Global method which creates the TrackingGeometry from DD4hep input

/// This method returns a std::unique_ptr of the Acts::TrackingGeometry from the
/// World DD4hep \a DetElement.
/// @pre Before using this method make sure, that the preconditions described in
/// @ref DD4hepPlugins are met.
///
///
/// @param [in] worldDetElement the DD4hep DetElement of the world
/// @param [in] loggingLevel is the debug logging level of the conversion and
/// geometry building
/// @param [in] bTypePhi is how the sensitive surfaces (modules) should be
/// binned in
/// a layer in phi direction. Possible binningtypes:
/// 	- arbitrary   - of the sizes if the surfaces and the distance inbetween
/// 		vary. This mode finds out the bin boundaries by walking through the
/// 		surfaces.
/// 	- equidistant - if the sensitive surfaces are placed euqidistant
/// @note equidistant binningtype is recommended because it is faster not only
/// while building of the geometry but also for look up during the
/// extrapolation
/// @param [in] bTypeR is how the sensitive surfaces (modules) should be binned
/// in a
/// layer in r direction
/// 	- arbitrary   - if the sizes if the surfaces and the distance inbetween
/// 		them vary. This mode finds out the bin boundaries by walking through the
/// 		surfaces.
/// 	- equidistant - if the sensitive surfaces are placed euqidistant
/// @note equidistant binningtype is recommended because it is faster not only
/// while building of the geometry  but also for look up during the

/// @param [in] bTypeZ is how the sensitive surfaces (modules) should be binned
/// in a
/// layer in z direction
/// 	- arbitrary   - if the sizes if the surfaces and the distance inbetween

/// 	- equidistant - if the sensitive surfaces are placed euqidistant
/// @note equidistant binningtype is recommended because it is faster not only

/// of the layers contained to build the volume envelope around
/// @param buildDigitizationModules Flag indicating if the
/// Acts::DigitizationModule (needed for Acts geometric digitization) will be
/// build for every single sensitive DD4hep DetElement translating directly the
/// DD4hep Segmentation.
/// @attention Turning on this flag can be very time and memory consuming! If
/// different modules are sharing the same segmentation (which will be the case
/// most of the times) please use the
/// Acts::ActsExtension(std::shared_ptr<const DigitizationModule>) constructor.
/// More information on the usage can be found
