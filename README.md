# A Common Tracking Software (ACTS) Project

This library is based on the track reconstruction software developed by the 
[ATLAS Collaboration](http://cern.ch/atlas).

The main philosophy is to provide high-level track reconstruction modules that 
can be specified for detector technologies by simple extension.

* event data model (EDM)
* geometry 
* track reconstruction tools

The library is attempted to build against Gaudi and Gaudi-Athena, while
additional external dependencies are kept at a minimum.


Please visit our [Wiki](https://gitlab.cern.ch/acts/a-common-tracking-sw/wikis/home) for more information.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Only few dependencies are required to build the Core library of ACTS. A list of 
prerequisites required is given below with the numbers indicating which versions 
were tested. Older versions may or may not work, feedback is very welcome.

The following dependencies are required:

+ [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) (>= 3.8.0) or [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (>= 4.9.3)
+ [cmake](https://cmake.org/) (>= 2.8)
+ [boost](http://boost.org/) (>= 1.59)
+ [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) (>= 3.2.8)

The following dependencies are optional and are only needed for some of the plugins

+ [doxygen](http://doxygen.org) (>= 1.6.1) for the documentation
+ [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) (>= 2.26.00) for the documentation
+ [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) (>= 6.06.04) for TGeo plugin
+ DD4Hep for DD4Hep plugin

## Installation

The ACTS repository is hosted on the GitLab instance at CERN. For the time being
you need to have a full CERN account in order to access the repository. We are working on
a solution for non-CERN users. We use cmake as build system for compiling and
installing ACTS libraries. For a complete description of the available cmake
options please see below.

In order to install the latest version, you can follow the instructions below
where \<DIR\> refers to some directory which needs to be set depending your configuration.

> git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/acts/a-common-tracking-sw.git \<ACTS_DIR\><br />
> mkdir \<BUILD_DIR\><br />
> cd \<BUILD_DIR\><br />
> cmake \<ACTS_DIR\> -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=\<EIGEN_INSTALLATION\> -DBOOST_ROOT=\<BOOST_INSTALLATION\><br />
> make<br />
> make install<br />

## cmake options

For a complete list of cmake options please refer to the [official documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/index.html)
and this nice [list of general cmake options](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables).
A full list of ACTS specific cmake options can be obtained by running the following command

> cmake \<ACTS_DIR\> -DPRINT_OPTIONS=ON

Important options relevant for the ACTS project are given below. They can be set
by adding '-D\<OPTION\>=\<VALUE\>' to the cmake command.

## Example build on lxplus at CERN

If you are logged in to lxplus at CERN, you could run the following commands
to install ACTS with all its components and run an example. Please note the 
ong cmake command which spans several lines.

> git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/acts/a-common-tracking-sw.git acts<br />
> mkdir acts/build<br />
> cd acts/build<br />
